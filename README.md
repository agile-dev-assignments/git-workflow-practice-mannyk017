**What I Found Ineresting:**

<p>Obviously the introduction of AI and robots will increase the efficiency of most processes, but within the realm of space machinary, AI increases time efficiency due to the unsolvable problem of distance. I had never thought about the fact that sattelites and space machinery, especially on other planets, to encounter communication delay. Take Mars for example, it can take anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes to transmit a signal to Mars, and another 5 to 20 minutes to receive a message from Mars. In the meantime, the machinery is constantly encountering new terrain, information, etc. Instead of having humans analyze all its new data before the machinery can operate, AI and deep learning allow the machinery to immediatley react on its own. This saves an incredible amount of time, and more importantly, keeps the machinery safe. While it is not mind-blowing, I did find it interesting to see how AI plays such a huge role, even for micro-movements, when human interference is physically just too far away.</p>  

## Comment (Elizabeth Lee)
I thought this article was really interesting because although I knew how large of a presence software and engineering has in space work, I never really looked into the intersection and what specific ways software is used in aerospace myself. I learned a lot about how AI and deep learning have a huge role in things like satellite operation and capturing images for analyzation. I think it's really cool to think about the power that software has and its ability to do things that humans ourselves cannot do with our own human skills.

The communication time delay in space is a very interesting problem. It makes sense that in order to reduce latency, the human element should be greatly reduced. Given the sheer amount of data and its availability, A.I. would seem to be better in the context than other applications. As the commercialization of space expands, I can easily see the reliability and accuracy of these A.I. applications increasing rapidly as more and more private and public investment enter the space (no pun intended).
